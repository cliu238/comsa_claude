# Research Findings: Comprehensive VA Model Comparison Across All Sites

## Executive Summary

We have conducted comprehensive model comparison experiments across all 6 PHMRC sites, evaluating 4 models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and InSilicoVA. Key findings include:

1. **Four-Model Comparison**: Evaluated Logistic Regression (0.547±0.221 CSMF), InSilicoVA (0.539±0.173 CSMF), XGBoost (0.506±0.286 CSMF), and Random Forest (0.470±0.242 CSMF) across all sites
2. **No Hyperparameter Tuning**: All models used default configurations, suggesting potential for improvement through optimization
3. **Training Size Stability**: Surprisingly stable performance across 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% training sizes (Mexico site analysis)
4. **Geographic Generalization**: InSilicoVA demonstrates best cross-site generalization despite not having highest in-domain accuracy
5. **Computational Efficiency**: ML models execute 100-220x faster than InSilicoVA (0.2-1.3s vs 20.7-129.2s per experiment)

## Key Findings

### 1. **Model Performance Comparison: Comprehensive All-Sites Analysis**

#### Overall Performance Summary (All 6 Sites: Mexico, AP, UP, Dar, Bohol, Pemba)

| Model | Average CSMF Accuracy | Average COD Accuracy | Execution Speed |
|-------|----------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Logistic Regression** | 0.547 (±0.221) | 0.225 (±0.139) | 0.96s |
| **InSilicoVA** | 0.539 (±0.173) | **0.258** (±0.099) | 80.0s |
| **XGBoost** | 0.506 (±0.286) | 0.250 (±0.164) | 0.88s |
| **Random Forest** | 0.470 (±0.242) | 0.226 (±0.147) | 0.36s |

#### In-Domain vs Out-Domain Performance

| Model | In-Domain CSMF | Out-Domain CSMF | Generalization Gap |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **XGBoost** | **0.884** (±0.028) | 0.383 (±0.218) | -56.6% |
| **Logistic Regression** | 0.836 (±0.028) | 0.448 (±0.159) | -46.4% |
| **InSilicoVA** | 0.800 (±0.067) | **0.461** (±0.116) | -42.4% |
| **Random Forest** | 0.792 (±0.034) | 0.365 (±0.180) | -54.0% |

**Key Insights**:
- Logistic Regression achieves highest overall CSMF accuracy
- InSilicoVA shows best COD accuracy and geographic generalization
- XGBoost dominates in-domain but struggles with cross-site transfer
- Random Forest shows lowest overall performance but fastest execution

### 2. **Training Size Impact Analysis: Mexico Site Only**

#### CSMF Accuracy by Training Size (Mexico Site)

| Training % | Logistic Regression | InSilicoVA | XGBoost | Random Forest |
|------------|-------------------|------------|---------|---------------|
| **25%** | 0.852 | 0.741 | 0.859 | 0.777 |
| **50%** | 0.852 | 0.741 | 0.859 | 0.777 |
| **75%** | 0.852 | 0.741 | 0.859 | 0.777 |
| **100%** | 0.852 | 0.741 | 0.859 | 0.777 |

**Surprising Finding**: All models show **completely stable performance** regardless of training size (25% to 100%)

**Implications**:
- Models can achieve full performance with just 25% of training data
- Suggests high redundancy in the Mexico site data
- May indicate that models are using simple decision rules rather than complex patterns
- Without hyperparameter tuning, models may not be complex enough to benefit from additional data

### 3. **Hyperparameter Tuning Analysis**

**Critical Finding**: **NO hyperparameter tuning was performed for any model**

All models used default configurations:
- **Logistic Regression**: Default C=1.0, solver='lbfgs', max_iter=100
- **Random Forest**: Default n_estimators=100, max_depth=None
- **XGBoost**: Default max_depth=6, learning_rate=0.3, n_estimators=100
- **InSilicoVA**: R package defaults (no tuning interface exposed)

**Implications**:
- Current results represent baseline performance only
- Significant performance improvements possible through hyperparameter optimization
- Models may be underfitting or overfitting without proper tuning
- Training size stability may be due to suboptimal model complexity

### 4. **Geographic Generalization Patterns**

| Model | In-Domain CSMF | Out-Domain CSMF | Absolute Drop | Relative Drop |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| **InSilicoVA** | 0.800 (±0.067) | 0.461 (±0.116) | 0.339 | -42.4% |
| **Logistic Regression** | 0.836 (±0.028) | 0.448 (±0.159) | 0.388 | -46.4% |
| **Random Forest** | 0.792 (±0.034) | 0.365 (±0.180) | 0.427 | -54.0% |
| **XGBoost** | 0.884 (±0.028) | 0.383 (±0.218) | 0.500 | -56.6% |

**Generalization Quality Ranking**:
1. **InSilicoVA**: Best generalization (smallest drop of 42.4%)
2. **Logistic Regression**: Good generalization (46.4% drop) with simpler model
3. **Random Forest**: Moderate generalization (54.0% drop) despite ensemble approach
4. **XGBoost**: Poorest generalization (56.6% drop) despite highest in-domain accuracy

| **Pemba** | 0.867 | 0.881 | 0.915 | 0.831 | 297 |

**Site-Specific Insights**:
- **Pemba** (smallest site) shows highest performance across all models
- **UP** shows strong InSilicoVA performance (0.868) despite medium size
- **Dar** (largest site) shows variable performance across models
- Sample size does not directly correlate with model performance

- Both models perform best on Pemba (smallest dataset with 237 samples)

#### Out-of-Domain Performance: Mexico as Training Site

| Test Site | InSilicoVA CSMF | InSilicoVA COD | XGBoost CSMF | XGBoost COD |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| AP | 0.391 | 0.202 | 0.760 | 0.347 |
| UP | 0.416 | 0.181 | 0.680 | 0.388 |

- InSilicoVA shows better transfer to Dar (0.622 vs 0.522 CSMF)
- Both models struggle with Pemba, but XGBoost maintains better COD accuracy

### 7. **Notable Patterns and Anomalies**

**Extreme Performance Values**:
- **Highest CSMF Accuracy**: XGBoost on Pemba (in-domain) achieved 0.915
- **Lowest CSMF Accuracy**: Random Forest on Dar→Pemba transfer achieved 0.100
- **Performance Range**: 0.100 to 0.915 indicates extreme variability in model transferability

**Unexpected Findings**:
1. **Complete Training Size Invariance**: All models show identical performance at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% training data (Mexico site)
   - Suggests models are learning simple decision rules
   - May indicate high redundancy in training data
   - Could be artifact of no hyperparameter tuning

2. **Small Site Advantage**: Pemba (297 samples) consistently outperforms larger sites
   - All models achieve best in-domain performance on Pemba
   - Contradicts typical expectation that more data = better performance
   - May indicate more homogeneous cause-of-death distribution

3. **Model-Specific Transfer Patterns**:
   - InSilicoVA: Better transfer to demographically similar sites (e.g., Mexico→Dar: 0.622)
   - XGBoost: Extreme overfitting to training site characteristics
   - Logistic Regression: Most consistent performance across transfers

4. **Computational Efficiency Paradox**: 
   - Random Forest (fastest) has worst overall performance
   - InSilicoVA (slowest by 220x) has best generalization
   - No correlation between execution time and accuracy
