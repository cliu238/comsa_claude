# Why TabICL and InSilico Don't Exhibit XGBoost's CSMF/COD Imbalance

## Executive Summary

While XGBoost shows a dramatic CSMF/COD accuracy ratio of **3.85** with limited training data (59 samples), TabICL (2.43) and InSilico (2.53) maintain relatively balanced performance. This document provides empirical evidence and intuitive explanations for why these models handle limited data so differently.

## Empirical Evidence from VA34 Comparison

### 1. Performance at 5% Training Data (59 samples)

| Model | CSMF Accuracy | COD Accuracy | CSMF/COD Ratio |
|-------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| **XGBoost** | 0.649 | 0.168 | **3.85** |
| **TabICL** | 0.510 | 0.209 | **2.43** |
| **InSilico** | 0.547 | 0.215 | **2.53** |

### 2. Error Pattern Consistency

Analysis of out-of-domain predictions reveals fundamentally different error behaviors:

| Model | CSMF/COD Ratio (Mean ± SD) | Max Ratio | Min Ratio |
|-------|----------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **XGBoost** | 2.92 ± 1.64 | 6.60 | 1.28 |
| **TabICL** | 2.17 ± 0.46 | 2.92 | 1.21 |
| **InSilico** | 2.16 ± 0.46 | 2.91 | 1.45 |

**Key Insight**: XGBoost's standard deviation (1.64) is 3.5× higher than TabICL/InSilico (~0.46), indicating highly inconsistent error patterns.

### 3. COD Accuracy Growth Patterns

How each model improves as training data increases:

| Training Size Jump | XGBoost | TabICL | InSilico |
|-------------------|---------|---------|----------|
| 5% → 25% | +0.926 | +0.505 | +0.471 |
| 25% → 50% | +0.310 | +0.498 | +0.391 |
| 50% → 75% | 0.000 | +0.121 | +0.081 |
| 75% → 100% | +0.162 | +0.121 | 0.000 |

**Pattern**: XGBoost shows erratic improvement (including zero growth 50%→75%), while TabICL maintains steady progress.

## The Fundamental Difference: Error Patterns

### XGBoost: Systematic Convergent Errors

With limited data, XGBoost's decision trees create a **"funnel effect"**:

```
True Disease Distribution:
Disease A: 30% ┐
Disease B: 20% ├─> XGBoost learns these are common
Disease C: 15% ┘
Disease D: 10% ┐
Disease E: 8%  ├─> XGBoost rarely/never predicts these
... (26 more)  ┘

Result: Most predictions converge to A, B, or C
```

**Why this happens:**
1. With 59 samples across 34 classes (~1.7 per class), many classes have 0-3 examples
2. Tree splits require minimum samples to be meaningful
3. First splits capture only "Is it a common disease?" → Yes/No
4. Insufficient data for finer distinctions

**Medical Analogy**: Like a doctor who only knows how to diagnose flu and pneumonia - they'll diagnose everything as one of these two, maintaining reasonable population statistics but failing individual cases.

### TabICL: Random Divergent Errors

TabICL's in-context learning produces **unstable, example-dependent** predictions:

```
Prediction Process:
1. Select k examples from training data
2. Find similar cases in examples
3. Predict based on similarity

Problem: Different example sets → Different predictions
Example Set 1: [A, B, C, D, E] → Predicts C
Example Set 2: [B, D, F, G, H] → Predicts G
Example Set 3: [A, C, E, I, J] → Predicts E
```

**Why no imbalance:**
- Errors scatter randomly across classes
- No systematic bias toward common diseases
- Each prediction is essentially a "lottery" based on which examples are selected

**Medical Analogy**: Like a medical student who consults different textbooks for each case - sometimes right, sometimes wrong, but errors don't follow a pattern.

### InSilico: Calibrated Probabilistic Errors

InSilico uses Bayesian inference with medical priors:

```
Bayes Formula:
P(Disease|Symptoms) ∝ P(Symptoms|Disease) × P(Disease)
                       ↑                      ↑
                  Learned from data      Medical priors

With limited data:
- P(Symptoms|Disease) is uncertain
- P(Disease) priors provide stability
- Errors still follow reasonable probability distributions
```

**Why no imbalance:**
- Prior knowledge prevents extreme predictions
- Maintains calibrated probabilities even with limited data
- Errors are "soft" - distributed according to medical knowledge

**Medical Analogy**: Like an experienced physician who knows disease prevalence - even when uncertain, their guesses follow realistic probabilities.

## Confusion Matrix Patterns

### Simplified 5-Class Example

Consider diseases: Heart Disease (40%), Pneumonia (25%), Stroke (15%), Cancer (10%), Other (10%)

**XGBoost Confusion Matrix** (Convergent Errors):
```
True\Predicted  Heart  Pneum  Stroke Cancer Other
Heart Disease   0.70   0.20   0.05   0.03   0.02
Pneumonia       0.50   0.35   0.10   0.03   0.02
Stroke          0.45   0.30   0.15   0.05   0.05
Cancer          0.40   0.30   0.15   0.10   0.05
Other           0.35   0.25   0.20   0.10   0.10
```
→ Everything funnels toward Heart Disease/Pneumonia

**TabICL Confusion Matrix** (Random Errors):
```
True\Predicted  Heart  Pneum  Stroke Cancer Other
Heart Disease   0.35   0.20   0.15   0.15   0.15
Pneumonia       0.25   0.30   0.15   0.15   0.15
Stroke          0.20   0.20   0.25   0.20   0.15
Cancer          0.20   0.20   0.20   0.25   0.15
Other           0.20   0.20   0.20   0.20   0.20
```
→ Errors spread evenly, no systematic pattern

**InSilico Confusion Matrix** (Probabilistic Errors):
```
True\Predicted  Heart  Pneum  Stroke Cancer Other
Heart Disease   0.50   0.25   0.10   0.08   0.07
Pneumonia       0.30   0.40   0.15   0.08   0.07
Stroke          0.25   0.20   0.30   0.15   0.10
Cancer          0.20   0.15   0.15   0.35   0.15
Other           0.25   0.20   0.15   0.15   0.25
```
→ Errors follow prior probabilities, balanced but realistic

## Technical Mechanisms

### Why XGBoost Fails with Limited Data

**Tree-Based Learning Requirements:**
```python
# For meaningful splits, XGBoost needs:
min_samples_split = 20  # Parent node
min_child_weight = 5    # Each child node
min_gain = 0.1          # Information gain

# With 59 samples, 34 classes:
samples_per_class = 1.7  # Far below requirements!
```

**Result**: Trees can only learn coarse patterns (common vs. rare), not fine distinctions.

### Why TabICL Maintains Balance

**In-Context Learning Design:**
```python
def tabicl_predict(query, training_data):
    # Each prediction uses different examples
    examples = random.sample(training_data, k=10)
    
    # Find similar cases
    similarities = compute_similarity(query, examples)
    
    # Prediction varies with example selection
    return weighted_vote(examples, similarities)
```

**Result**: No fixed decision boundary → no systematic bias.

### Why InSilico Maintains Balance

**Bayesian Framework:**
```python
def insilico_predict(symptoms):
    # Start with medical priors
    prior = load_who_mortality_rates()
    
    # Update with limited evidence
    likelihood = estimate_from_small_data(symptoms)
    
    # Posterior combines both
    posterior = likelihood * prior / evidence
    
    return posterior  # Still reasonable even with weak likelihood
```

**Result**: Prior knowledge prevents collapse to extreme predictions.

## Practical Implications

### Model Selection Guidelines

| Scenario | Recommended Model | Reasoning |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| **<100 training samples** | TabICL or InSilico | Designed for limited data |
| **Population surveillance** | Any model | All provide reasonable CSMF |
| **Individual diagnosis** | Avoid XGBoost with small data | COD accuracy too low |
| **New site with no data** | TabICL | Best zero/few-shot performance |
| **Site with medical priors** | InSilico | Leverages domain knowledge |

### Key Takeaways

1. **XGBoost's imbalance is unique** because it learns fixed decision boundaries that collapse to majority classes with limited data

2. **TabICL avoids imbalance** through random, example-dependent predictions that don't systematically favor any class

3. **InSilico avoids imbalance** through Bayesian priors that maintain reasonable probability distributions

4. **The CSMF/COD ratio** is a useful diagnostic for detecting systematic prediction bias

5. **With <100 samples**, avoid tree-based models for individual predictions; use them only for population statistics

## Conclusion

The stark difference in CSMF/COD ratios (XGBoost: 3.85 vs. others: ~2.5) reveals fundamental differences in how models handle limited data:

- **XGBoost**: Systematic errors converging to common classes → High CSMF, Low COD
- **TabICL**: Random errors with no pattern → Balanced CSMF and COD
- **InSilico**: Probabilistic errors following priors → Balanced CSMF and COD

Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for:
- Selecting appropriate models for data-scarce scenarios
- Interpreting model outputs correctly
- Setting realistic performance expectations
- Designing effective ensemble strategies

**Bottom Line**: When you have limited training data (<100 samples) and need individual-level predictions, choose TabICL or InSilico over XGBoost. The CSMF/COD imbalance in XGBoost is not just a statistical quirk—it reflects a fundamental limitation of tree-based learning with insufficient data.
