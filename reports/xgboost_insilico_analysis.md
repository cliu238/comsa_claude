## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Motivation and Impact

Verbal autopsy (VA) is a critical tool for determining causes of death in regions lacking comprehensive vital registration systems. As countries and organizations deploy VA systems across diverse populations, the ability of models to generalize across different sites becomes paramount. Our analysis reveals a concerning trade-off: while modern machine learning approaches like XGBoost offer computational efficiency and high accuracy within their training domain, they suffer significant performance degradation when applied to new sites.

This generalization gap has profound implications:
- **Public Health Impact**: Misclassification of causes of death can lead to misallocation of health resources
- **Equity Concerns**: Models that fail in certain regions may exacerbate health disparities
- **Deployment Costs**: Poor generalization necessitates site-specific model training, increasing operational complexity
- **Trust and Adoption**: Unreliable models undermine confidence in automated VA systems

### 1.2 Research Objectives and Scope

## 3. Empirical Results Analysis

### 3.1 Overall Performance Comparison

Based on 80 experiments across all site combinations:

| Metric | XGBoost | InSilicoVA | Difference |
|--------|---------|------------|------------|
| Average CSMF Accuracy | 0.529 (±0.226) | 0.543 (±0.178) | +0.014 |
| In-domain CSMF | 0.815 | 0.800 | -0.015 |

- **XGBoost extremes**: Shows both best (85.8% Dar→Dar) and worst (3.3% Dar→Pemba) performance
- **InSilicoVA consistency**: More uniform performance across site pairs

### 3.3 Generalization Gap Analysis

![Generalization Gap Distribution](results/full_va34_comparison_complete/reports/figures/generalization_gap_distribution.png)

Statistical analysis reveals:
- **XGBoost**: Mean gap = 0.377, Std = 0.041, Range = [0.295, 0.425]
- **InSilicoVA**: Mean gap = 0.339, Std = 0.032, Range = [0.285, 0.385]
- **Significance**: p < 0.01 (Welch's t-test)

### 3.4 Site-Specific Patterns

Analysis of site characteristics affecting generalization:

**Best Training Sites** (for cross-site transfer):
1. AP: InSilicoVA achieves 53.7% average transfer vs XGBoost's 44.0%
2. Bohol: Both models transfer reasonably well (XGB: 56.1%, INS: 49.9%)

2. Dar: High variance in XGBoost transfers (±22.7%)

![Performance by Region](results/full_va34_comparison_complete/reports/figures/performance_by_region.png)

### 3.5 Failure Mode Analysis

![Failure Mode Analysis](results/full_va34_comparison_complete/reports/figures/failure_mode_analysis.png)

Critical failure patterns:
- **Catastrophic failures** (<20% CSMF): XGBoost has 5 pairs, InSilicoVA has 0
- **Severe failures** (20-40% CSMF): XGBoost has 15 pairs, InSilicoVA has 12
- **Common failure mode**: Small training sites (Pemba) generalize poorly
- **XGBoost vulnerability**: Extreme sensitivity to distribution shift

### 3.6 Training Size Impact

From the training size experiments on AP site:

| Training Size | XGBoost CSMF | InSilicoVA CSMF |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| 25% | 0.716 | 0.743 |
| 50% | 0.760 | 0.736 |
| 75% | 0.828 | 0.834 |
| 100% | 0.818 | 0.797 |

Surprisingly, both models show slight performance degradation at 100% training data, suggesting potential overfitting.

## 4. Algorithmic Deep Dive

### 4.1 XGBoost: Gradient Boosting Mechanism

XGBoost builds an ensemble of decision trees through iterative residual fitting:

```
F(x) = Σ(k=1 to K) fk(x)
```

Where each tree fk learns to correct residuals from previous iterations.

**Key Properties**:
- **Objective**: Minimize loss + regularization: L(y, F(x)) + Ω(F)
- **Tree Construction**: Greedy split finding based on gradient statistics
- **Feature Interactions**: Arbitrary high-order interactions through tree depth
- **Regularization**: L1/L2 penalties on leaf weights, tree complexity penalty

**Why XGBoost Overfits to Sites**:
1. **High Model Capacity**: Deep trees can memorize site-specific patterns
2. **Feature Co-adaptation**: Trees learn to exploit spurious correlations
3. **No Domain Constraints**: Purely data-driven without medical knowledge
4. **Gradient Optimization**: Aggressively minimizes training error

### 4.2 InSilicoVA: Bayesian Hierarchical Framework

Based on McCormick et al. (2016, JASA), InSilicoVA models:

```
P(Cause|Symptoms) ∝ P(Symptoms|Cause) × P(Cause)
```

**Hierarchical Structure**:
```
Individual level: Yi ~ Categorical(θi)
Symptom model: Sij|Yi ~ Bernoulli(pij)
Population level: θ ~ Dirichlet(α)
Hyperpriors: α ~ Gamma(a, b)
```

**Key Properties**:
- **Conditional Independence**: Assumes symptoms are conditionally independent given cause
- **Population Modeling**: Hierarchical priors regularize individual predictions
- **MCMC Inference**: Full posterior distribution via Gibbs sampling
- **Medical Priors**: Incorporates expert knowledge through informative priors

**Why InSilicoVA Generalizes Better**:
1. **Structured Regularization**: Hierarchical priors prevent overfitting
2. **Medical Constraints**: Prior knowledge acts as inductive bias
3. **Probabilistic Framework**: Uncertainty quantification reduces overconfidence
4. **Population-Level Learning**: Borrows strength across individuals

### 4.3 Feature Interaction Comparison

**XGBoost Feature Interactions**:
- Learns arbitrary interactions through tree splits
- Example: `if (fever AND cough AND age>50) then pneumonia`
- Can capture complex site-specific symptom combinations
- No limit on interaction order (depends on tree depth)

**InSilicoVA Feature Handling**:
- Assumes conditional independence: P(S1,S2|Cause) = P(S1|Cause) × P(S2|Cause)
- Cannot directly model symptom interactions
- Relies on marginal symptom-cause associations
- Interactions captured indirectly through cause distributions

### 4.4 Regularization Mechanisms

**XGBoost Regularization**:
```
Ω(f) = γT + 0.5λ||w||² + α||w||₁
```
- γ: Minimum loss reduction for split
- λ: L2 penalty on leaf weights
- α: L1 penalty on leaf weights
- Max tree depth constraint

**InSilicoVA Regularization**:
- Hierarchical shrinkage through Dirichlet priors
- Information sharing across population
- Medical knowledge constraints
- MCMC convergence acts as implicit regularization

### 4.5 Computational Complexity

**XGBoost**:
- Training: O(n × d × K × log(n))
- Prediction: O(K × log(n))
- Memory: O(n × d)
- Parallelizable across trees and features

**InSilicoVA**:
- Training: O(n × d × C × I)
- Prediction: O(d × C × I)
- Memory: O(d × C)
- Where I = MCMC iterations (typically 10,000+)

The 62.4x speed difference reflects MCMC sampling overhead vs efficient tree construction.

## 8. Conclusion

### 8.1 Summary of Key Insights

Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off in VA model design:
- **XGBoost** excels at learning complex patterns within a specific site but fails to generalize due to overfitting to local distributions
- **InSilicoVA** trades computational efficiency and some in-domain accuracy for superior cross-site robustness through Bayesian regularization

The 37.7% vs 33.9% generalization gap represents more than a statistical difference—it reflects contrasting philosophies in model design: data-driven empiricism versus knowledge-guided inference.

### 8.2 Limitations of Analysis

1. **Dataset Scope**: Analysis limited to 6 PHMRC sites
2. **Model Configurations**: Default hyperparameters may not be optimal
3. **Temporal Stability**: No assessment of performance over time
4. **Cause Structure**: Limited to VA34 categorization
5. **Implementation Details**: Some strategies require extensive development

### 8.3 Call to Action

The global health community must prioritize model generalization alongside accuracy. We recommend:
1. **Immediate**: Adopt ensemble methods for multi-site deployments
2. **Near-term**: Invest in feature engineering and domain adaptation
3. **Long-term**: Develop new architectures that balance efficiency and robustness

As VA systems scale globally, the ability to reliably classify causes of death across diverse populations will determine their ultimate impact on public health. The strategies outlined in this report provide a roadmap for achieving this goal.
